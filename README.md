## NewsNER: Named Entity Recognition In News Articles Using Natural Language Processing

## Introduction:

NewsNER is a specialized Named Entity Recognition (NER) system developed to enhance information extraction from news articles using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project utilizes state-of-the-art algorithms to achieve high precision, recall, and F1-scores in identifying and classifying named entities within diverse news content.

## Project Goals:

- **Accuracy**: Develop a robust NER model that identifies and classifies entities accurately.
- **Innovation**: Explore cutting-edge NLP algorithms and techniques to improve performance.
- **Applicability**: Evaluate the model across various news articles to ensure its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

## Installation:

To set up NewsNER for use or development, follow these steps:

**1. Clone this repository:**
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NewsNER.git
   
**2. Install required Python packages:**
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## Datasets:

This project uses two main datasets from Kaggle:

**News Articles Classification Dataset**: Contains various news articles categorized into topics for NER training.
**Named Entity Recognition (NER) Dataset**: Features annotated news articles for performance evaluation.

Both datasets are integral for training and testing the NER models developed in this project.

## Models:

NewsNER incorporates two primary models:

**LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Utilizes multiple LSTM layers to capture long-range dependencies within text data effectively.
**SpaCy NER Model**: Employs a pre-trained model for quick and efficient named entity recognition.

## Usage:

To run NewsNER on your data, use the following command:

python newsner.py --input yourfile.txt


This script will load the trained model and print the named entity recognition results directly to your terminal.
